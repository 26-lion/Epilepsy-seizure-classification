# Epilepsy-seizure-classification
# Introduction
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder. It is diagnosed by EEG data.Diagnosing of epilepsy is a time consuming task.\
Here I give a deep learning models to read and classify time series EEG recording data as epilepsy or not
## Dataset 
Dataset was taken from UCI machine learning repository.Link below\
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition
## Code
Sequential.ipynb it contains a simple 1-dimensional sequential model for classification\
Resnet-&-Inception.ipynb contains 1-dimensional Resnet and Inception architectures for classification.They were made to compare the ROC-AUC results with simple sequential model
